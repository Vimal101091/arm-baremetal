Steps to run GDB with QEMU:
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234   # Connect to QEMU
(gdb) load                           # Load the ELF into QEMU memory
(gdb) break Reset_Handler            # Optional: Breakpoint before your main
(gdb) continue                       # Start execution
step or s	                         # Step into the next instruction or function call
next or n	                         # Step over a function call (run it without entering)
continue or c	                     # Resume program execution until the next breakpoint
si	                                 # Step one machine instruction (useful in assembly)
ni	                                 # Next instruction, but doesn't step into function
